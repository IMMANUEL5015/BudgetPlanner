# BudgetPlanner

## Overview
This web application is designed to help people plan their budget and expenses

## Purpose
I built this project, merely as a means to practise and showcase my knowledge of jQuery.

## Notice
This is not a real budget app! It will not store your information. In short, once you
refresh the page, all your details will disappear. It stores your data, only for the
current browing session.

For best experience, use the Chrome Browser.
